# Description: This program prompts the user for their age and birth year, then displays their age and year based on the input.
# Initial Algorithm:
#   1. Prompt user for their age.
#   2. Read and store the age.
#   3. Prompt user for their birth year.
#   4. Read and store the birth year.
#   5. Print "You were born in" message.
#   6. Print birth year.
#   7. Print "and you are" message.
#   8. Print age.
#   9. Print "years old." message.
# Data Requirements
# Input Variables: $v0 (age input), $v0 (year input)
# Output Variables: $a0 (output message), $a0 (age)
# Addition Variables: $t0 (temporary storage for age), $t1 (temporary storage for birth year)
# Formulas: None
# Refined Algorithm:
#   1. Prompt the user for their age by loading the address of the age prompt into $a0.
#   2. Use syscall code 4 to print the age prompt.
#   3. Use syscall code 5 to read the integer input from the user and store it in $v0.
#   4. Move the user's age from $v0 to $t0 for temporary storage.
#   5. Prompt the user for their birth year by loading the address of the year prompt into $a0.
#   6. Use syscall code 4 to print the year prompt.
#   7. Use syscall code 5 to read the integer input (birth year) from the user and store it in $v0.
#   8. Move the user's birth year from $v0 to $t1 for temporary storage.
#   9. Load the address of the output message "You were born in" into $a0.
#  10. Use syscall code 4 to print the output message.
#  11. Print the user's birth year stored in $t1 using syscall code 1.
#  12. Load the address of the "and you are" message into $a0.
#  13. Use syscall code 4 to print the "and you are" message.
#  14. Print the user's age stored in $t0 using syscall code 1.
#  15. Load the address of the "years old.\n" message into $a0.
#  16. Use syscall code 4 to print the "years old.\n" message.
#  17. Exit the program using syscall code 10.
